# memory

A memory game i made as a school project about 2 years ago, im so glad i found the source code and i am now uploading it to github to hopefull keep it forever
it uses windows forms to generate a bunch of buttons which are induviduial cards

Memory game i made, i'm really proud of it, i think it turned out amazing, and its pretty fun to play

you start playing by clicking the start button on the left, if you have easy mode enabled you can click hint which will show all the cards for 2 seconds.

it also has a 2 player mode which allows you to play this game with 2 players, it keeps their induvidual scores, and highligts the current players turn







verry fun game to play i reccomand you download and give it a try
